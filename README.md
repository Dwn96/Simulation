# Simulation
Simple queue simulation

This simple project simulates 1000 dice rolls (or whatever you want to set it to).
First  a random number is generated between 0 and 1(1 is not inclusive), with each range of 1/6, from 0  representing a single face.
For example 0-1/6 would represent face 1, 1/6-2/6 represents face 2 and so on. (The die is balanced,ik)

The total number of outcomes for each face is then stored in a jtable,alongside the percentage of occurences.
