# Simulation
Simple class exercises

This simple project simulates 1000 dice rolls (or whatever you want to set it to).
First i generate 24 random numbers, with each set of 4 digits from 0 respectively representing a single face.
For example 0-3 would represent face 1, 4-7 represents face 2 and so on.

The total number of outcomes for each face is then stored in a table,alongside the percentage of occurences.
